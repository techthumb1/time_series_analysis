# Time Series Analysis


### What is time series analysis?

Time series analysis is a type of statistical analysis that deals with the temporal behavior of a series of data points. It is used to predict future values from past values, and to monitor the trend or non-trend stationarity. T

The univariate case is used for analyzing a single variable, such as a stock price, while the multivariate case is used for analyzing multiple variables at once, such as a set of economic indicators. 

The time series data can be either stationary or non-stationary. The stationary case is used for analyzing a series of data points that do not change over time, while the non-stationary case is used for analyzing a series of data points that change over time. 

The time series data can be either periodic or non-periodic. The periodic case is used for analyzing a series of data points that are repeated at regular intervals, while the non-periodic case is used for analyzing a series of data points that are not repeated at regular intervals.


### Project: Time Series Analysis

This repo will consist of several different soures that will exhibit time series analysis and forecasting methods used in a economic and financial modeling,*   
 - Consumer Price Index (CPI)
 - Employment and Wages
 - Personal Consumption Expenditures
 - Stock Prices
 - 10 year US Government Bond Yields
 - Cyptocurrency Prices

### What is the purpose of this project?

The scope of this project is to demonstrate the use of time series analysis and forecasting methods in a financial modeling context. The project will be used to predict the future value of the consumer price index (CPI), employment and wages, and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for the next 10 years. The project will also be used to predict the future value of the 10 year US government bond yields.
